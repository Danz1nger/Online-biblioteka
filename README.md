Project by students of ICT Cortex.

### Getting Started with Create React App
This project uses Create React App. Available scripts:

- npm install: Install dependencies.
- npm install axios react-router-dom
- create .env file in root directory with:
`REACT_APP_API_URL=https://biblioteka.simonovicp.com/api/login
REACT_APP_API_TOKEN=b3Rvcmlub2xhcmluZ29sb2dpamE=`

- npm start: Run the app in development mode at http://localhost:3000. The page reloads on changes and shows lint errors in the console.
- npm test: Launch the interactive test runner.
- npm run build: Build the app for production in the build folder, optimizing for best performance. The app is then ready for deployment.
